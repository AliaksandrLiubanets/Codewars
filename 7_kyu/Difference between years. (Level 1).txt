Task:

Write a function that receives two strings as parameter. This strings are in the following format of date: YYYY/MM/DD.
Your job is: Take the years and calculate the difference between them.

Examples:
'1997/10/10' and '2015/10/10' -> 2015 - 1997 = returns 18
'2015/10/10' and '1997/10/10' -> 2015 - 1997 = returns 18
At this level, you don't need validate months and days to calculate the difference.


Solution:

const howManyYears = (date1, date2) => {
    function dateToNumber(date) {
      return Number(date.split('/')[0])
    }

    return Math.abs(dateToNumber(date1) - dateToNumber(date2))
}
