Task:

Due to another of his misbehaved, the primary school's teacher of the young Gauß, Herr J.G. Büttner, to keep the bored and unruly young schoolboy Karl Friedrich Gauss busy for a good long time, while he teaching arithmetic to his mates, assigned him the problem of adding up all the whole numbers from 1 through a given number n.

Your task is to help the young Carl Friedrich to solve this problem as quickly as you can; so, he can astonish his teacher and rescue his recreation interval.

Here's, an example:
f(n=100) // returns 5050 


Solution:

function f(n){
  if(typeof n === 'string' || n <= 0 || n === undefined || n % 1 !== 0) {
    return false
  }  
  
  const numArr = []
  
  for(let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    numArr.push(i)
  }
  
  return numArr.reduce((acc, el) => acc + el, 0)
}
