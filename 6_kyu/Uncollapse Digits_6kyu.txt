Task:

You will be given a string of English digits "stuck" together, like this:
"zeronineoneoneeighttwoseventhreesixfourtwofive"

Your task is to split the string into separate digits:
"zero nine one one eight two seven three six four two five"


Example: 
"three"              -->  "three"
"eightsix"           -->  "eight six"
"fivefourseven"      -->  "five four seven"
"ninethreesixthree"  -->  "nine three six three"
"fivethreefivesixthreenineonesevenoneeight"  -->  "five three five six three nine one seven one eight"


Solution:

const uncollapse = (digits) => digits.match(/zero|one|two|three|four|five|six|seven|eight|nine/g).join(' ')
