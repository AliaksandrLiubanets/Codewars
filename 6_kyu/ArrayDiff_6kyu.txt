Task:

Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.

Example: 
arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]


Solution:

const arrayDiff = (a, b) => a.filter(elem => !b.includes(elem))
